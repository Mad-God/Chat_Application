WHY Testing?
    higher application quality
    easier refactoring: changing the code without changing the behaviour
    easier version upgrades


Types of Testing:
    Unit testing: 
        test one piece independently of other pieces
        fastest to run  
    
    Integration testing:
        test multiple pieces together to assure that they work well with one another
    
    Functional testing:
        test that everything works from the end-user's point of view
        slowest to run
        done with tools like selenium


Setup  Tests and Testing URL:
    create a tests folder inside each of the applications and inside these folders, create separate files for testing separate aspects of a projects like test_urls, test_views, test_forms & test_models. Also, create the dunder __init__.py file for this folder.

    Now, django looks at files, classes, and functions that start with "test" and executes them.

    Now, in each of these files, import SimpleTestCase, and write classes subclassing this class. Define a few methods in these classes with name starting with "test". 

    to run the tests, use the commnad-
        manage.py test application_name
